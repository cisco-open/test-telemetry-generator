## Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone, especially if they are to expand the available functionality or address one of the [open issues](https://github.com/cisco-open/test-telemetry-generator/issues). You will need the following to start with:
* Github access, obviously
* JDK 11
* Gradle 5.6.4 or above

Once you have the above setup:
* Clone the project
* Create a new branch on your local machine
* Make the changes and add tests for your changes
* Run all tests in your local using
`./gradlew clean build test` for Linux/Mac
`gradlew.bat clean build test` for Windows
Doing this in local will ensure that the tests pass on the Github workflow too
* Push your branch and open a pull request with a good description of the changes being made
* Someone will review and we may suggest some changes, improvements or alternatives

Thank you and happy coding!
