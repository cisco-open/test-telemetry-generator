## Purpose

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is an open source collection of tools, APIs and SDKs which can be used to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your software's performance and behavior. If you are working on platforms that are built to ingest OpenTelemetry (OTel) data and have a need to provide OTel data as input to your platform services for testing or otherwise, either you can actually configure OTel collectors on your infrastructure to export the telemetry data (adding to your infra costs), or you will have to write code to generate hardcoded OTel packets. The issue with the former approach is that you do not know what data (metrics/logs/traces) is being actually sent and the latter would result in long term maintainability issues.  

The test-telemetry-generator tries to solve this requirement by acting like an OpenTelemetry exporter which can generate and export OpenTelemetry data without actually monitoring anything. It provides a relatively readable and flexible way of specifying the telemetry data to be generated via YAML files which can be easily modified at any stage to tune the output OTel data without changing your code at all.  

Although we can see that the key users of this tool would be test-engineers but this can be used by developers to perform quick checks on their platform and sales engineers to demo the platforms without having to write a lot of code or setting up OTel exporters on actual infra.

## How to use

This tools can be added to your code as a dependency or executed from the command-line. The repository [wiki](https://github.com/cisco-open/test-telemetry-generator/wiki) will help in understanding how to set up the pre-requisites and consume this tool as per your requirements.

***

## Quickstart

For a quick start with a basic setup you can download the [latest fat-jar](https://github.com/cisco-open/test-telemetry-generator/releases/download/latest/test-telemetry-generator-otel-proto-0.9.0-fatjar.jar) and [example definitions](./example-definitions/) and put them all into one directory.

You can do all of that in the command line using [curl](https://curl.se/) like the following:

```shell
mkdir my-test-telemetry
cd my-test-telemetry
curl -O https://github.com/cisco-open/test-telemetry-generator/releases/download/latest/test-telemetry-generator-otel-proto-0.9.0-fatjar.jar
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisco-open/test-telemetry-generator/master/example-definitions/entity-definition.yaml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisco-open/test-telemetry-generator/master/example-definitions/trace-definition.yaml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisco-open/test-telemetry-generator/master/example-definitions/cli-target-rest.yaml
```

Your `my-test-telemetry` directory should now contain the following files:

```shell
$ ls
cli-target-rest.yaml  entity-definition.yaml  test-telemetry-generator-otel-proto-0.9.0-fatjar.jar  trace-definition.yaml
```

Next, open the `cli-target-rest.yml` with an editor of your choice and set the `restURL` to your OTLP HTTP endpoint. For example, if you use an [OpenTelemetry
Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) running on `localhost` with an `otlp` receiver listening on port `4318`, update your target config to look like the following:

```yaml
username: "ignored"
password: "ignored"
restURL: "http://localhost:4318/v1/traces
```

Finally, start the test-telemetry-generator:

```shell
java -jar test-telemetry-generator-otel-proto-0.9.0-fatjar.jar -e entity-definition.yaml -s trace-definition.yaml -t cli-target-rest.yaml
```

If all goes well, you should see test-telemetry-generator printing out some logs for you:

```text
...
10:10:08.525 [main] INFO  i.o.c.g.t.t.dto.Traces - 6jz87jHycn1T7hIE7c7zfKWnsIIBTAwI: Initializing 6 trace trees
10:10:08.530 [main] INFO  i.o.c.g.t.t.TracesGenerator - 6jz87jHycn1T7hIE7c7zfKWnsIIBTAwI: Initializing 6 trace generator threads
...
```

As a next step, you can add metrics and logs as well by downloading some more [example definitions](./example-definitions/):

```shell
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisco-open/test-telemetry-generator/master/example-definitions/log-definition.yaml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisco-open/test-telemetry-generator/master/example-definitions/metric-definition.yaml
```

Start the test-telemetry-generator:

```shell
java -jar test-telemetry-generator-otel-proto-0.9.0-fatjar.jar -e entity-definition.yaml -s trace-definition.yaml -t cli-target-rest.yaml -l log-definition.yaml -m metric-definition.yaml
```

Again, you will see test-telemetry-generator printing out some logs for you and you should also see traces, metrics and logs flowing into your OTLP endpoint.

You now have a working setup from which you can build your own telemetry test environment. Update the definition files to your needs and read the [wiki](https://github.com/cisco-open/test-telemetry-generator/wiki) to learn more.
